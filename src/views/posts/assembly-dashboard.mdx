## Assembly Dashboard

The **Assembly Dashboard** is a full-featured CRM designed for Assembly VFX to support the Sales team in managing data related to longform and shortform productions, clients, budgets, events, and other studio operations.

I worked as both **Designer and Full-Stack Developer**, leading the project from the initial concept and UX design to the full-stack implementation, infrastructure setup, and deployment.  
The images below represent **Figma design screens only**, as the production version of the application is restricted.

### Tech Stack

**Typescript, ReactJS, Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy ORM, MySQL, Docker, AWS, ChakraUI**

### Responsibilities

- UX/UI design, wireframes, and interactive prototypes in Figma
- Frontend architecture and implementation using React
- Backend development with Python, Flask, and SQLAlchemy ORM
- Database modeling and integration with MySQL
- DevOps setup using Docker and AWS
- Full end-to-end delivery, from concept to production deployment

### Core Features

- Management of **contacts**, **companies**, **projects**, and **events**
- Table and board (Kanban) views with drag-and-drop interactions
- Advanced filtering tools by owner, name, type, and custom fields
- Detailed panels with contact history, associated clients, and project data
- Notes and activity tracking for internal team communication
- Additional registers for _Departments_, _Budgets_, _Addresses_, _Tags_, and _Users_
- Light and dark modes for extended daily use

### Design Preview

The following images represent selected interface screens created during the Figma design phase:

<div class="blogGallery">
  <Media src="/work/assembly/1.png" />
  <Media src="/work/assembly/2.png" />
  <Media src="/work/assembly/3.png" />
  <Media src="/work/assembly/4.png" />
  <Media src="/work/assembly/5.png" />
  <Media src="/work/assembly/6.png" />
  <Media src="/work/assembly/7.png" />
  <Media src="/work/assembly/8.png" />
  <Media src="/work/assembly/9.png" />
  <Media src="/work/assembly/10.png" />
</div>

Although only the design can be shown publicly, the **Assembly Dashboard** was fully implemented and deployed internally, becoming a key tool for the Sales team to manage studio-wide commercial data.

Here are some of my works as a developer for 3D pipeline.

## What is Maya Inspector?
It is a scene inspector for the Autodesk Maya software. It allows the user to select a variety of tests to be run on their scene, and then the Maya Inspector will execute these tests and return the results to the user.

## The Animation Transfer
Once the scene has been inspected and validated, it can proceed and continue its production; however, in some situations, the animations of a character need to be reused for other characters. That's why Animation Transfer brings the ease of transfer through the on-screen workflow.

## Some usage examples:

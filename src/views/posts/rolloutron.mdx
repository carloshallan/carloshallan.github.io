Rolloutron was a tool that I loved having built. This time the idea had already been created by colleagues and primarily by end users of the tool. They created an initial concept and put it into practice with a script. Then, I was summoned to enhance the tool and add a professional touch to it.

With Rolloutron, projects and languages can be managed in the same environment within Adobe After Effects.
Users can translate and generate new videos in a simple and fast manner, and also share settings among the team.

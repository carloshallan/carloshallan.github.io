In previous articles, I mentioned that I am working on the development of Momo, a software geared towards creative writing projects. The main goal of Momo is to provide me with a more useful environment that allows me to write and just write using various features that will make the most of my time. This means that the project’s primary client is myself. After giving considerable thought to how I would like to store my files, I began to consider reasons why writers would choose to use Momo over any other competitor. And I concluded that using local storage seems to be the best option. In this article, I will share the main reasons behind this decision.

## Security and privacy
I imagine that one of the main concerns for writers is the security and privacy of their work. By choosing local storage, it is possible to ensure that documents and projects are stored directly on the user’s device, reducing the risks associated with cloud storage, such as data leaks or unauthorized access. This creates a problem of sharing between devices, but I still don’t know how often a writer changes devices to write. To address this, I plan to add transfer solutions via Google Drive, One Drive, iCloud, or Dropbox as I develop versions for different devices, but for the initial goal, Momo should only recommend the use of backup tools.

## Complete control over data
With local storage, writers have complete control over their data without relying on third-party services to manage it. This allows users to back up their projects and documents more efficiently, as well as having the freedom to move and store their files as they wish. This is because the idea is for Momo to also integrate various types of text files such as *.docx, *.txt, *.md, and *.opt.

## Internet connection is not an obstacle
Often I find myself looking for a quiet and comfortable environment to write, and usually, this comfort comes along with a lack of internet. I also like to leave my MacBook at home and go out with my lighter Chromebook. On it, I have locally stored texts and end up preferring to write in software like IA Writer or MarkText for local, uninterrupted writing. I also want Momo to be able to recognize texts from tools coming from other platforms and devices, such as FreeWrite, for example, further expanding its functionalities.

## Better cost and simplicity
Finally, by eliminating the need for cloud storage resources, I will be reducing the costs associated with the development and maintenance of Momo. In addition, the simplicity of local storage makes the software easier to use and understand by users, regardless of their level of knowledge in technology. Not to mention the speed of access to local files which will certainly be much better than accessing many texts on a remote server. Development costs also include the time and complexity of maintaining web servers. As a solo developer, any cost reduction is very welcome.

In summary, by choosing local storage for Momo, I seek to provide writers with a safer, more private, and efficient work environment. I believe that this decision will increase users’ trust in the software and contribute to a more enjoyable and productive creative writing experience. Let me know if you have another opinion on this. And if you want to know more about Momo, I invite you to read this article about the decision to use Tauri instead of Electron or another tool.

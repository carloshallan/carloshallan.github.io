In this project, I worked as a Full Stack Engineer and UI/UX Designer, developing a food safety training software. The project was built using ReactJS, NextJS, and Firebase.

The Project was divided into two parts:

- Tangerine Classroom
- Tangerine Manager

## Tangerine Classroom
The first training by Tangerine. It was designed to be a food safety training platform, where the user can undergo training and receive a certificate upon completion.

## Tangerine Manager
The Tangerine manager. It was designed to be a training management platform, where the user can create trainings, manage users, and generate reports. In the first MVP, the tool only manages one training but generates reports and allows bulk registrations.

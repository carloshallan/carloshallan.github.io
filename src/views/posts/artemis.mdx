Here we have two design concepts of a project manager:

1. Artemis;
2. ArtSpace;

Both are the same project, but the Artemis visual was chosen to be the final design.

The idea behind Artemis was to unite all work from different art departments into a single environment, with the sharing of works just like on a social media platform.

## [2025] Roof Cover Look – Visual Search and Frame Player

In **January 2025**, I developed a desktop application using **Tauri 2, React, and TailwindCSS** on the frontend and a **Python API** on the backend. The tool was created for **Roof Studio** and used in the production of a film celebrating the **100th anniversary of _The New Yorker_**, which featured more than **5,000 historic magazine covers**.

## Challenge

- **Tight deadline**: 1 week for a usable prototype, 1 month for the final version.
- **Large dataset**: handling **5,000 high-resolution covers**.
- **Creative search**: artists needed to find visual patterns — **context, color, temperature** — to connect covers and build seamless sequences.
- **Specialized player**: frame-by-frame navigation without audio, but with visual precision.

## Solution

- **Frontend in Tauri 2** → lightweight, cross-platform desktop app.
- **React + TailwindCSS** → fast iterations and an intuitive UI.
- **Python backend** → API for image processing and indexing.
- **Key features**:
  - Local folder image selection.
  - Grid view + interactive timeline.
  - **Frame-by-frame player** to review sequences.
  - **Visual search by context, color, and temperature**, enabling quick discovery of similar covers.

## Impact

The application was used throughout production, helping the creative team **identify and connect visual patterns across thousands of covers**. What began as a 7-day prototype evolved into a robust production tool within a month, becoming essential for organizing and shaping the film’s visual narrative.

## [2021 - 2023] Roof Share Tool – A File Transfer Desktop App

In **2021**, I developed **Roof Share Tool**, a desktop application built with **Electron, Vue 3, TypeScript, and Vuetify**. The tool was designed for a **3D film production pipeline**, enabling artists working from home to **sync large files** efficiently, similar to Dropbox but optimized for heavy production assets.

  />
</div>

## Challenge

- **File size & reliability**: transfer and sync very large 3D assets and sequences.
- **Version control**: ensure correct file syncing and maintain local version integrity.
- **Cost reduction**: leverage **local machines for 3D scene processing** instead of relying entirely on AWS compute resources.
- **Integrations**: support workflows with **Autodesk Maya** and **Adobe After Effects**.

## Solution

- **Electron app** → desktop solution for cross-platform usage.
- **Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vuetify** → modern UI with fast development and consistency.
- **AWS storage backend** → reliable file hosting and retrieval.
- **Built-in automations** for production workflows (upload, sync, project structure setup).
- **Seamless integrations** with Maya and After Effects to connect directly with artists’ tools.

## Impact

Roof Share Tool became a **core part of the studio’s remote production pipeline**, ensuring reliable file transfer and versioning for artists working across locations. By shifting some 3D rendering tasks to local machines, the tool also helped **reduce AWS compute costs** while keeping collaboration smooth and efficient.

# [2019] Maya Animation Exporter – 3D Game Pipeline Tool

In **2019**, I developed a desktop tool for **Wildlife Studios** using **Electron, React, and pure CSS**. The application was integrated with **Perforce** and built to **export 3D character scenes and animations** from **Autodesk Maya** for use in mobile games.

  />
</div>

## Challenge

- Ensure **stable integration with Autodesk Maya** through Electron.
- Automate a previously **manual export workflow**, where animators had to manually send files to game developers.
- Maintain compatibility with Perforce for version control within the studio’s production pipeline.

## Solution

- **Electron desktop app** → cross-platform solution accessible to artists.
- **React + CSS** → clean UI for file exploration and exporting.
- **Direct integration with Maya** → enabled animators to export animations and assets with one click.
- **Perforce integration** → ensured that exported files were properly versioned and synced with the studio’s pipeline.

## Impact

The tool significantly **reduced the time animators spent exporting and transferring 3D assets**, streamlining the workflow between animation and development teams. What once required manual steps became a **fast, reliable export process**, allowing developers to receive updated assets almost instantly.
